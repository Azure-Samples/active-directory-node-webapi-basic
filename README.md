# Securing a Node.js REST-based Application with Azure Active Directory

---

There's a newer version of this sample taking advantage of the Microsoft identity platform (formerly Azure AD v2.0)

Check it out: [active-directory-javascript-nodejs-webapi-v2](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-javascript-nodejs-webapi-v2)

If you really need to access this Azure AD v1.0, you can navigate to the [master](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-node-webapi-basic/tree/master) branch, but please know that it's no longer supported.
